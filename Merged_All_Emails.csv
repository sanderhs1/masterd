specifically part concerns socalled integration issues folks im speaking directly integrationcentric techies getting way making soa success probably due misunderstandings misconceptions soa work correct misunderstanding need speak language language integration technology problem service consumer service provider communication typical integration environments youre primarily concerned movement data amalgamation business logic achieve specific task vein integration developers think inputs gazintas outputs gazattas transfer transformation think theyre going get data application functionality one system theyll get another system mechanism theyll use get information functionality one place another need its enroute transform one format protocol context process policy another architects chemists scientists trying understand system put together integration developers chemical engineers focusing mechanisms transformation integrationcentric mentality integration developers see concept service another means gazinta gazatta means integrationheads need find something else transfer transformation vendors rescue vendors responded desire simply dusting existing integration middleware endusers responded easily insignificant change voila transfer transform deal servicebased gazintasgazattas make soa weve already beaten head million times lets take different tack reason approach wrong services consumers might think gazinta never communicate directly service providers might erroneously think gazatta first main concept soa want deal frequent unpredictable change constructing architectural model discipline abstraction looselycouples providers capability consumers capability environment continuous heterogeneity means somehow develop capabilities without knowledge might used delved seven aspects loose coupling previous zapflash means need significant variability variety aspects including implementation infrastructure contract process policy data schema semantic aspects variability allows companies stability business even though business continue change agility predictability reliability visibility costeffectiveness become much realistic achieve sort abstraction achieve abstraction means cant afford things break things change lots things change business environment location availability services versioning service implementations contracts changes business processes policies new changing requirements reporting visibility control course need new capabilities solve emerging business problems capitalize new business opportunities however think service api hell breaks loose try connect service consumer directly service provider provider moves service contract changes provider longer available need new communication mechanism change data schema first kneejerk reaction complexity integration architects put piece technology service consumers providers ameliorate problem impulse correct cant direct communication want variability however execution wrong relying blackbox often proprietary technology heavy lifting managing service communication differences youll simply shift complexity work endpoints services increasingly complex expensive brittle middle point welcome eai secret unpublicized real name socalled enterprise service bus esb products least way many using reintroducing service proxy reworked middleware isnt solution well course answer architecture thats pat answer speak parlance integration developers lets explore system would designed cant count particular vendors solution middle make work lets say want build service consumer consume compose functionality dont know functionality even communicate least three ways handling particular challenge first talk proxy broker intermediary language understand thats location already know send request proxy act behalf consumer envelope within envelope concept basically enclose message deliver someone know dont know within envelope addressed party know party opens envelope addresses internal envelope end recipient based lookup sort approach simplifies problem service consumer know changes since need know proxy endrecipient technology perspective use wsaddressing simplifies approach essence service consumer needs know wsaddress provider hand service proxy resolve deliver weve discussed concept service intermediary problem approach service proxy still needs find way deliver message proxy contains rules internally blackbox problem eai style esb solutions registry steps service proxies store rules rather get routing location policybased binding rules central system record soa role registry proxies cache results registry lookups performance enhancement metadata come registry registryconfigured service proxies solve many problems service communication still leaves open problem connection service consumer service proxy proxies move unavailable service consumers find service proxy first place answer challenge use registrybased late binding scenario service consumer pings registry find proxy perhaps based service consumer currently located protocols communicate one would think make service consumer directly bind service provider finding metadata registry would mistake problem service provider using alternate protocol location service consumer cant reach well communications problem even case were discovering metadata registry still dont want direct communication service consumer provider therefore optimal solution use registrybased latebinding help service consumers find proxies also help resolve service providers wsaddresses service consumer communicates proxy providing wsaddress required metadata communication allows service consumers quite simple leveraging network distributed likely heterogeneous service proxies communication behalf service consumers scenario companies implement service proxies using mixing wide range technologies approaches including hardwarebased network intermediaries software proxies even agents reside service consumer endpoints finally scenario wheres esb nowhere unless believe esb pattern product ibm espoused esb needed necessarily make feel better buy one anyways maybe course proxies surely esb vendors want believe products used proxies configuration thats absolutely true certainly point esbs cant make good proxies certainly want specifically point also get away using one using existing infrastructure still work sad truth integration architects using esbs service proxies rather eai hubandspoke messagebus brokers facilitate web services integration soa zapthink take think weve already implemented complex heterogeneous networks fashion computers leverage dhcp gateways routers networking way thats far superior
